# Sketch 5: Gif It Up

**Add animated GIFs to your Twine Game (Sketch 3).**

## Rules

1. You must use Adobe Photoshop to create at least 5 original GIFs.
2. You may build upon and animate images you find on the web. However, there are two things you may not do:
   a. You may not use any photographic images of real living persons.   
   b. You may not edit or adapt an “already animated” GIF or video file. Adapting a static (non-animated) GIF or any other still image file is OK.
3. The dimensions of your GIFs should not exceed 800px (wide) by 800px (tall).
4. The maximum file size of each GIFs should be less than 1 MB.
5. Fork this sketch on GitHub and submit your game as an HTML document with comments. (In Twine, use “Publish to File,” then upload to GitHub.)
